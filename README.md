# credit-card-fraud-detection-analysis
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The model is trained on a dataset of historical transaction data, where various features such as transaction amount, location, and customer demographics are used to predict the likelihood of fraud.
